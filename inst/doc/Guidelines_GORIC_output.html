<div id="goal-gorica" class="section level1">
<h1>Goal GORIC(A)</h1>
<p>The information criteria GORIC and GORICA - referred to as GORIC(A) -
are AIC-type information criteria and can evaluate one or more
informative, theory-based hypotheses. Hence, you do not have to specify
a null hypothesis nor (only) equality restrictions. You can (also)
compare the size and/or ordering of mean parameters or of (standardized)
regression-type parameters. You could, for example, evaluate the
hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_m: \mu_1 &gt; \mu_2 &gt;
\mu_3\)</span> (a simple ordering of mean parameters) or <span class="math inline">\(H_m: \beta_1 - \beta_2 &gt; \beta_3 -
\beta_4\)</span> (a possible representation of an interaction effect in
terms of regression parameters). The goal of the GORIC(A) is to select
the best from a set of candidate hypotheses/models.</p>
</div>
<div id="gorica-output" class="section level1">
<h1>GORIC(A) output</h1>
<p>The GORIC(A) is an information criterion and, therefore, balances fit
and complexity. <strong>Fit</strong> denotes the compatibility of the
hypothesis with the data, expressed by the <em>maximum log
likelihood</em> part. <strong>Complexity</strong> reflects the size of
the hypothesis in terms of (expected) number of parameters, expressed by
the <em>penalty</em> part. Stated otherwise, GORIC(A) selects the
hypothesis that describes the data best with the fewest number of
parameters, out of a set of candidate hypotheses.</p>
<div id="gorica-values" class="section level2">
<h2>GORIC(A) values</h2>
<p>The hypothesis with the smallest GORIC(A) value is the preferred one
in the set of candidate hypotheses; since that hypothesis then has the
smallest (Kullback–Leibler) distance to the truth. The GORIC(A) values
themselves are not interpretable; only the differences between the
values can be inspected (i.e., the smaller, the better). To improve the
interpretation, GORIC(A) weights can be computed.</p>
</div>
<div id="gorica-weights-and-ratios" class="section level2">
<h2>GORIC(A) weights and ratios</h2>
<p>A <strong>GORIC(A) weight (<span class="math inline">\(w_m\)</span>)</strong> represent the relative
likelihood of a hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_m\)</span>)
given the data and the set of hypotheses. The hypothesis with the
largest GORIC(A) weight is the preferred one in the set of candidate
hypotheses. Additionally, the <strong>ratio of two GORICA weights (<span class="math inline">\(w_m/w_{m&#39;}\)</span>)</strong> can be used to
quantify their relative support. This leads to conclusions like
Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(w_1/w_2\)</span> more supported than the competing
hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="hypotheses-sets" class="section level1">
<h1>Hypotheses sets</h1>
<p>The set of hypotheses should consist of the hypotheses of interest
(reflecting one or more theories from the literature or ones based on
expertise), possibly with a failsafe hypothesis (to prevent from
selecting a hypothesis which is the best of the worst). I will
distinguish different types of set of hypotheses: The first distinction
is based on the number of informative hypotheses: one or more; The
second distinction is based on the choice of safeguard hypothesis. In
the next section, I will describe these type of sets and give guidelines
for interpretation the results from each of them. I will also remark on
how to specify your hypothesis such that the GORIC(A) output helps you
even more. Subsequently, I will discuss two special cases situations one
should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The case of equal fit, which can happen in case of overlapping
hypotheses. This is discussed together with finding support for the
boundary of hypotheses;</p></li>
<li><p>The case of just below maximum fit, which can occur when there is
at least one equality restriction in (one of) the hypothesis under
investigation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, be aware of specifying overlapping hypotheses and
hypotheses containing one or more equality restrictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="interpretation-output" class="section level1">
<h1>Interpretation output</h1>
<div id="general" class="section level2">
<h2>General</h2>
<p>In general, the GORIC(A) output is interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The hypothesis with the <strong>highest GORIC(A) weight</strong>
is the preferred one: the best from the set.</p></li>
<li><p>The GORIC(A) weight of that hypothesis denotes its relative
strength in the set (given the data).<br />
The <em>GORIC(A) weights reflect the (un)certainty regarding that
hypothesis being the best</em> - but be aware that it is conditional on
the other hypotheses in the set.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, one can compare the strength of that hypothesis
versus a competing hypothesis using the ratio of their GORIC(A)
weights.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As discussed later on, you need to inspect a bit more output to check
for special cases (like support for overlap of the hypotheses of
interest). Generally good advise - as will become clear later on -
<strong>before interpreting the ratios of GORIC(A) weights, one needs to
check the (ratio of) fit/loglik weights of the preferred hypotheses with
that of the other hypotheses in the set</strong>. Additionally, you may
want to take into account the sample size you have.</p>
<p>Next, I will go into more detail for each type of hypothesis set.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-informative-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2>One informative hypothesis</h2>
<p>Here, I assume you have one informative hypothesis, that is, there
are no competing hypotheses of interest. Then, I would advise you to
evaluate it with its complement (an option in the software), as opposed
to the unconstrained hypothesis. Nevertheless, I will describe both
situations next.</p>
<div id="vs-complement" class="section level3">
<h3>vs Complement</h3>
<p>The complement of a hypothesis denotes all the other possible
hypotheses (i.e., all the other possible orderings); so, excluding the
one of interest. The complement acts like a competing hypothesis. Either
your (informative) hypothesis or its complement is the best and the
ratio of their GORIC(A) weights denotes the relative strength.</p>
<p>Say, your hypothesis of interest has a GORIC(A) weight of <span class="math inline">\(w_m\)</span> and, thus, its complement of <span class="math inline">\(w_c = 1 - w_m\)</span>. Then, your hypothesis has
<span class="math inline">\(w_m/(1-w_m)\)</span> more support than its
complement. This relative support can go from (approximately) zero to
infinity - the first denoting <em>infinite support for the
complement</em> and the latter <em>infinite support your
hypothesis</em>. When the ratio is close to 1, then <em>both hypotheses
are (approximately) equally good</em> (in terms of balancing fit and
complexity). Notably, the ratio of GORIC(A) weights together with other
output can also denote support for their boundary, which is discussed in
the Special cases Section.</p>
<p>When inspecting a hypothesis versus its complement, one can interpret
<span class="math inline">\(1 - w_m = w_c\)</span> as a error
probability. That is, the probability that <span class="math inline">\(H_m\)</span> is not the best one is <span class="math inline">\(w_c*100\%\)</span>. Note that in case of multiple
hypotheses, especially in case of overlapping hypotheses, I would not
advise on using this (conditional) error probability interpretation,
since <span class="math inline">\(w_m\)</span> and thus <span class="math inline">\(1-w_m\)</span> depends on the other hypotheses in
the set.</p>

The order-restricted hypothesis &#39;H1&#39; has 4.88 times more support than its complement.</code></pre>
<p>From this, you can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_1:
\mu_1 &gt; \mu_2 &gt; \mu_3\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(.83/.17 \approx 4.88\)</span> time more supported
than its complement.<br />
Additionally, one could say that the probability that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is not the best is 17%.</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:2:1;
implying that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is correct. More
specifically, I used population mean values of approximately 0.98, 0.65,
and 0.33. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .27; thus, there is a
small to medium population effect size (which are in the same order as
hypothesized). I then sampled 100 observations, ran an ANOVA (with three
groups), and applied the GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, the GORIC(A) weight for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> converges to 1 (denoting full support
for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>).</p>
<p>Note: As will become clear in the Special cases Section, one should
first check the ratio of fit/loglik weights (i.e. ratio of
loglik.weights), since there could be support for the boundary of these
two hypotheses. Since the loglik.weights differ (i.e., the ratio of
loglik.weights is not close to 1), there is no support for the boundary
of these hypotheses; only support for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="vs-unconstrained" class="section level3">
<h3>vs Unconstrained</h3>
<p>The unconstrained hypothesis denotes all the possible hypotheses
(i.e., all the possible orderings); so, including the one of interest.
Since it covers the hypothesis of interest, it cannot act like a
competing hypothesis. The unconstrained can only be used as a
failsafe:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the unconstrained is better (i.e., has a higher weight), then
your hypothesis of interest is weak, that is, it is not supported by the
data.</p></li>
<li><p>If <em>your hypothesis</em> is better (i.e., <em>has a higher
weight</em>), then it is <strong>not weak</strong>. In this case, the
ratio of GORIC(A) weights is bounded (as described in the Example
section below) and should, therefore, not be interpreted. Stated
otherwise, in this case, the ratio of GORIC(A) weights will never go to
infinity; as it would do in the case of using the complement. Here, a
ratio of GORIC(A) weights equal to its bound denotes full support; even
when the sample size is small.<br />
Therefore, I advise using the <em>complement</em> in case of one
informative hypothesis; because, then, the resulting ratio of GORIC(A)
weights is not bounded, and the <em>weights reflect the uncertainty
there is</em> (in case of a small sample size).</p></li>

The order-restricted hypothesis &#39;H1&#39; has 4.88 times more support than its complement.</code></pre>
<p>From this, you can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_1:
\mu_1 &gt; \mu_2 &gt; \mu_3\)</span> is more supported than the
unconstrained (since <span class="math inline">\(.763/.237 &gt;
1\)</span>) and is, therefore, not a weak hypothesis.</p>
<p>When you look at the fit/loglik value, you can see that they are the
same for both hypotheses (also reflected by the loglik.weights; leading
to a ratio of loglik.weights of 1). The unconstrained has, by
definition, the maximum fit. Here, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> also has maximum fit, meaning that
its restrictions are in agreement with the data. Since both have the
same fit, their GORIC(A) weights solely depend on the penalty values
and, thus, are bounded: they equal the penalty.weights (and thus not 1
and 0, what you otherwise would find in case of full support). Finding
equal fit (or GORIC(A) weights being equal to the penalty weights) means
that there is support for the overlap (see also the Special cases
Section).<br />
The informative hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is
completely contained in the unconstrained (by definition). Hence, the
overlap of the two hypotheses is <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>. Therefore, we can say that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> has (full) support: it has the
maximum fit and is (by definition) more parsimonious than the
unconstrained. Note that, now, we cannot say anything regarding the
uncertainty (which we could in the case of using the complement as the
failsafe).</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:2:1;
implying that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is correct. More
specifically, I used population mean values of approximately 0.98, 0.65,
and 0.33. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .27; thus, there is a
small to medium population effect size (which are in the same order as
hypothesized). I then sampled 100 observations, ran an ANOVA (with three
groups), and applied the GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, the GORIC(A) weight for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> remains the same. When I would have
sampled less observations, the fit/loglik values may differ. Then, the
GORIC(A) weight of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is less than
the penalty weight of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note: In case of one informative hypothesis of interest, I would
advise on using the complement instead (as done in the previous
section). Then, the support for a true hypothesis increases with sample
size (and/or effect size). Moreover, you have information regarding the
uncertainty of your decision: In the example above, one would conclude
that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> has (full) support; while
using the complement (in the previous example), one would conclude that
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is preferred and that there is
an uncertainty of 17%, namely a 17% chance that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is not the best.</p>

<h2>Multiple informative hypotheses</h2>
<p>Let us assume that the literature states two competing informative
hypotheses. Then, a safeguard hypothesis is needed if these informative
hypotheses do not cover the whole parameter space, that is, do not cover
all possible theories/orderings. Namely, when both informative
hypotheses are weak hypotheses, GORIC(A) selects the best out of a set
of weak hypotheses (i.e., best of the worst). To refrain from this, one
should then include a safeguard hypothesis.</p>
<div id="complement-as-failsafe" class="section level3">
<h3>Complement as failsafe</h3>
<p>The complement of a set of hypotheses denotes all the other possible
hypotheses (i.e., all the other possible orderings); so, excluding the
ones of interest. The <strong>complement acts like another competing
hypothesis</strong>. One can also compare its strength to that of the
hypotheses of interest.</p>
<p>As always, the hypothesis with the highest GORIC(A) weight is the
preferred one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the best hypothesis is the complement of the set, then the
hypotheses of interest are weak. One should not compare the strength of
the hypotheses of interest (to avoid choosing the best from worst). Bear
in mind that one can, if that would be of interest, compare the strength
of the complement versus each of the hypotheses of interest by
inspecting their ratio of GORIC(A) weights.<br />
Notably, one can take on an additional exploratory approach to create
one or more new hypotheses for future research.</p></li>
<li><p>If the best hypothesis is one of the hypotheses of interest, then
it is not weak and can be compared to the other hypothesis/-es of
interest (including the complement). Note that one can compare all the
non-weak hypotheses to all the hypotheses of interest.<br />
Be aware of the special cases, as will be discussed in the Special cases
Section.</p></li>

software.</p>

<h3>Unconstrained as failsafe</h3>
<p>The unconstrained hypothesis denotes all the possible hypotheses

<p>From this, you can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_1:
\mu_1 &gt; \mu_2 &gt; \mu_3\)</span> is not a weak hypothesis, since it
is <span class="math inline">\(.763/.237 &gt; 1\)</span> times more
supported than the unconstrained. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> can be compared to its competing
hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_2: \mu_1 &lt; \mu_2 &lt;
\mu_3\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> is
weak <span class="math inline">\((.000/.237 &lt; 1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(.000 &lt; .237)\)</span>; so, we already know that
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is better, but not yet how much
better.</p>
<p>From the GORIC weights (or their ratios in results_12u$ratio.gw - H1
vs. H2), you can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>
is .763/.000 = an infinite times (or 2871.23 times) more supported than
<span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>. This denotes (almost) full
support for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>.<br />
In comparison, if you would calculate the GORIC(A) weights for the set
consisting of solely <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> (thus, without the unconstrained),
you would obtain GORIC weights of 1.000 and .000, respectively; denoting
full support for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:2:1;
implying that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is correct. More
specifically, I used population mean values of approximately 0.98, 0.65,
and 0.33. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .27; thus, there is a
small to medium population effect size (which are in the same order as
hypothesized in <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>). I then
sampled 100 observations, ran an ANOVA (with three groups), and applied
the GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, it does not affect the results in
this case. In case <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> did receive
some support (i.e., had a GORIC(A) weight larger than 0), increasing the
same size would lead to GORIC(A) weights as reported here, where the
ratio of GORIC(A) weights for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>
and the unconstrained is fixed and the ratio of GORIC(A) weights for
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> is infinite.</p>
<p>Note: As will become clear in the Special cases Section, one should
first check the ratio of fit/loglik weights (i.e. ratio of
loglik.weights) of the best hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and the other hypotheses, since there
could be support for the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and one of the other hypotheses.
Since the loglik.weights of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and
its competing (non-overlapping) hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> differ (i.e., their ratio of
loglik.weights is not close to 1), there is no support for the boundary
of these hypotheses; only support for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>.</p>

<div id="note-hypothesis-specification" class="section level2">
<h2>Note: Hypothesis specification</h2>
<p>A hypothesis is considered the best of the set if it has the highest
GORIC(A) weight. In that case, all ratios of GORIC(A) weights of that
hypothesis versus another one is 1 or higher. In case of decision
making, you may want to pre-specify a cut-off value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for the ratio of GORIC(A) weights: if
the ratio of GORIC(A) weights is larger than <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then I am willing to choose (to make
policy based on) this best hypothesis. It can be hard to pre-specify
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>; unless there is already previous
research perhaps. Therefore, my advise is to create the hypotheses in
such a way that finding a ratio of 1 (or higher) is enough evidence for
the preferred hypothesis. I would also advise against overlapping
hypotheses and using equality restrictions; for more detail, see the
special cases discussed in the Special cases Section.</p>
<p>For example, let us assume that we compare an outcome (e.g., a
standardized level of happiness) for three types of treatments: a new
treatment (A), the established treatment (B), and a placebo treatment
(P). You could evaluate <span class="math inline">\(H_{1g}: \mu_A &gt;
\mu_B &gt; \mu_P\)</span> versus its complement <span class="math inline">\(H_c\)</span>. Now, it can be hard to decide to go
for Treatment A when <span class="math inline">\(H_{1g}\)</span> is 1 or
perhaps 1.1 times more supported than <span class="math inline">\(H_c\)</span>. Then, it could be handy (if
possible) to specify the hypothesis in such a way that a ratio of (just
over) 1 makes you willing to choose for Treatment A. You could specify a
minimum difference between Treatments A and B and additional state (as a
check) that Treatment B (and then also A) does better than the placebo:
<span class="math inline">\(H_{1m}: \mu_A - \mu_B &gt; .1, \ \mu_B &gt;
\mu_P\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note: <span class="math inline">\(H_{1g}: \mu_A &gt; \mu_B &gt;
\mu_P\)</span> can be rewritten as <span class="math inline">\(H_{1g}:
\mu_A - \mu_B &gt; 0, \ \mu_B &gt; \mu_P\)</span>. In <span class="math inline">\(H_{1m}\)</span>, the (minimum)
difference/bound/threshold of 0 is replaced by .1, the minimum
difference in treatments you would like to find.</p>

<p>From this, you can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_{1m}:
\mu_1 - \mu_2 &gt; .1, \ \mu_2 &gt; \mu_3\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(.865/.135 \approx 6.4 &gt; 1\)</span> times more
supported than its complement. Since the difference in treatment means
is at least as large as pre-specified, you can now convincingly go for
Treatment A.<br />
[Note: Since the fit/loglik weights differ (i.e., the ratio of
loglik.weights is not close to 1), there is no support for the boundary
- as discussed in the Special cases Section - but solely for <span class="math inline">\(H_{1m}\)</span>.]</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:2.5:1;
implying that both <span class="math inline">\(H_{1g}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_{1m}\)</span> are correct. More specifically, I
used population mean values of approximately 0.89, 0.74, and 0.30. This
implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is
approximately .25; thus, there is a small to medium population effect
size (in the same ordering as hypothesized). I then sampled 100
observations, ran an ANOVA (with three groups), and applied the
GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, the GORIC(A) weight of both <span class="math inline">\(H_{1g}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_{1m}\)</span> will converge to 1, reflecting
full support; and the ratio of GORIC(A) weights of the hypothesis of
interest versus its complement will go to infinity.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When specifying a bound for a positive difference (e.g., the .1
in the example above), you should use the minimum difference you would
like to find. If you use a higher bound/threshold then needed, the
complexity does not change, while the fit decreases; which leads to less
support for your hypothesis of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>In case you want to inspect an absolute difference, you can make
use of the abs() function (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(|\beta_1|
&gt; |\beta_2|\)</span> can be reflected in the code (using b1 and b2)
via abs(b1) &gt; abs(b2); or, when using bounds/thresholds, abs(b1) -
abs(b2) &gt; .1); as is explained in GORIC(A) tutorials.</p></li>

<h2>Equal fit</h2>
<div id="overlapping-hypotheses" class="section level3">
<h3>Overlapping hypotheses</h3>
<p>You should be aware when some of the hypotheses overlap. Note that
all hypotheses overlap with the unconstrained hypotheses (per
definition). Also, competing hypotheses can overlap; e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 &gt; \beta_2, \ \beta_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 &gt; \beta_2 &gt; \beta_3\)</span>
overlap, since the latter is a subset / special case of the first.</p>
<p><strong>When hypotheses overlap and the truth lies in this
overlapping part (i.e., in the subset)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Then, the overlapping hypotheses share support, that is, they
divide the support. Consequently, none of them will obtain full support
(i.e., a GORIC(A) weight of 1); and their relative support (i.e., ratio
of GORIC(A) weights) is even bounded. Bear in mind that the most
parsimonious hypothesis will be the best one.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, the fit/loglik values of the overlapping hypotheses will be
equal (i.e., the ratio of loglik.weights will be 1), that is, these
overlapping hypotheses will have the same maximum log likelihood. In
that case, the ratio of GORIC(A) weights will be solely based on the
penalty part (and thus equal the so-called penalty weights).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, it does not make sense to interpret the ratio of GORIC(A)
weights of these overlapping hypotheses, you just know that there is
support for the overlap of the hypotheses.<br />
If possible and if of interest, you can specify the overlap and evaluate
that versus its complement (to obtain the support for the overlapping
part). This can be of interest for future research. Notably, if the
overlap cannot easily be specified, one can alternatively inspect the
best hypothesis versus its complement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, when hypotheses have the same fit values (and thus when the
ratio of their loglik.weights equal 1), you know that there is support
for the overlap of the hypotheses. Note that, when one hypothesis is a
subset of another, this implies support for the subset. Note further
that, in some cases, this implies support for the boundary of
hypotheses, as will be discussed in a section later on.</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>when there is support for only one of the
overlapping hypotheses</strong>, this implies support for the
non-overlapping part. Bear in mind that the GORIC(A) weight itself
addresses the support for the complete hypothesis, not the overlap. If
possible and if of interest, you can specify the (non-)overlapping part
and evaluate that versus its complement (to obtain the support for this
(non-)overlapping part). This can be of interest for future research:
You then create a more specific hypothesis or more adjusted set of
hypotheses to be evaluated in future research which aids in theory
building.</p>

respectively, times more supported than the unconstrained. Therefore,
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> can be compared.
<!-- From the GORIC weights goric.weights (or their ratios in results_12u\$ratio.gw - H1 vs. H2), you can conclude that $H_1$ is $.548/.281$ times (or $1.95$ times) more supported than $H_2$. -->
<!-- Notably, if you would calculate the GORIC(A) weight for the set consisting of solely $H_1$ and $H_2$, you would obtain $.548/(.548+.281) \approx .66$ and $.34$. --></p>
<p>From the GORIC weights, we can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is the best. Before we interpret the
ratio of GORIC weights (i.e., goric.weights), we need to check the
fit/loglik values of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>. These are the same, that is, the
ratio of loglik.weights is 1. Hence, the relative support (denoted by
the GORIC weight) is bounded and, now, attains the maximum value. Thus,
there is support for the overlap of the hypotheses, which is <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> here (since <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>).</p>
<p>You could choose to investigate the support for this overlap, by
evaluating <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> versus its
complement. We already did this in the first example subsection, there
we found that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is 4.88 times
more supported than its complement (with an error probability of 17%).
For future research, you could advise to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> versus its complement.</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:2:1;
implying that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is correct. More
specifically, I used population mean values of approximately 0.98, 0.65,
and 0.33. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .27; thus, there is a
small to medium population effect size (which are in the same order as
hypothesized). I then sampled 100 observations, ran an ANOVA (with three
groups), and applied the GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, it does not affect the GORIC(A)
weights for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, and the unconstrained.</p>

(which would have been their boundary then; more details can be found in
a section later on). From the GORIC weights goric.weights (or their

<p>Since we know/see that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and

When I would sample more observations, the ratio of GORIC(A) weights for

GORIC(A) weight of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> would go to
0, but that of <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> not to 1 since

<h3>Support for boundary</h3>
<p>When hypotheses do not overlap, there can mathematically still be
overlap, namely the boundary of these hypotheses. This is always the
case when evaluating an informative hypothesis versus its complement,
but can also be the case for other pairs of hypotheses. As a very simple
example: The overlap/boundary of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1
&gt; 0\)</span> and its complement (here, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 &lt; 0\)</span>) is <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consequently, when non-overlapping hypotheses have (approximately)
the same fit values (and thus when the ratio of loglik.weights
(approximately) equal 1), you know that there is support for the
boundary of these hypotheses.</p>

<!-- From this, you can conclude that $H_1: \mu_1 > \mu_2 > \mu_3$ is $.683/.317 \approx 2.16$ time more supported than its complement. -->
<p>From the GORIC weights, we can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is the best. Before interpreting the
ratio of GORIC(A) weights, one needs to check the fit/loglik values (or
the ratio of their weights). From the output, you can see that the fit
values of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and its complement
resemble (-123.450 vs -123.384) and, thus, their loglik.weights are
almost the same (.483 vs .517; i.e., their ratio is close to 1).
Likewise, you can see that the GORICA weights resemble the penalty
weights (for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, .683 vs .698).
This indicates that there is support for the boundary of the hypotheses.
Bear in mind that the overlap of a hypothesis and its complement is the
boundary of them.<br />
In this example, the boundaries are:<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \mu_2 &gt; \mu_3\)</span>,<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 &gt; \mu_2 = \mu_3\)</span>, and<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3\)</span>.<br />
Now, you can take two approaches: i) do an exploratory evaluation of
these hypotheses (as done below) or ii) inspect the sample means (by
looking at coef(fit)). Here, based on both approaches, you would
conclude that there is support for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1
&gt; \mu_2 = \mu_3\)</span>. This hypothesis can then be proposed to be
evaluated in future research.<br />
If of interest, one can also evaluate this boundary hypothesis versus
its complement. Notably, such a boundary hypothesis contains at least
one equality (here, there is one), which you may want to rephrase as an
about-equality, as discusses in a next section; and exemplified in the
the follow-up analysis in a next section.</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:2:2;
implying that (the boundaries of) <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and its complement are both correct
(where <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is the most parsimonious
one). More specifically, I used population mean values of approximately
0.71, 0.482, and 0.48. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .11; thus, there is a
small population effect size. I then sampled 100 observations, ran an
ANOVA (with three groups), and applied the GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, the fit values will become more
closer and the GORIC(A) weights will converge to the penalty
weights.</p>

<div id="notes" class="section level3">
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Note 1:<br />
A ratio of GORIC(A) weights of 1 means that the hypotheses are equally
likely (in terms of balancing fit and complexity). Then, both hypotheses
are equally supported. This does not per se mean that there is support
for their overlap (or boundary). Only when the penalty values of the
hypotheses are the same, this coincides. For example, the penalty of
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 &gt; 0\)</span> equals that of its
complement (here, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 &lt; 0\)</span>),
thus their ratio of GORIC(A) weights will equal 1 when <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span>.<br />
Bear in mind that when the ratio of GORIC(A) weights equals the ratio of
penalty weights (which does not need to be 1), then there is support for
the overlap (or boundary). Likewise, one can look for equal fit values
(reflected by a ratio of loglik.weights of 1), as done in all the
examples.</p>
<p>Note 2:<br />
There are no cut-off values for fit values to resemble or for the ratio
of loglik.weights being close to 1 (only gut feelings). Since the fit
values depend on sample size, it is probably better to look the ratio of
loglik.weights. Additionally, it could help to check the estimates that
belong to those hypotheses (using, e.g., results_0c$ormle) and see if
they meaningfully differ.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="just-below-maxmimum-fit" class="section level2">
<h2>Just below maxmimum fit</h2>
<div id="equality-restriction" class="section level3">
<h3>Equality restriction (=)</h3>
<p>Even if an equality restriction (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \beta_2\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0\)</span>) is true in the
population, the probability of finding this in your data is 0. In your
data, the relationship will never be exactly equal. Therefore, the fit
value (i.e., the maximum log likelihood) of a true hypothesis with
equality restriction will never equate the maximum fit (i.e., the
maximum log likelihood of the unconstrained), but a value (just) below
this maximum. Consequently, a true hypothesis with equality restriction
will never obtain a GORIC(A) weight of 1, but one lower than 1.</p>
<p>Hence, be aware of interpreting your results when there is at least
one equality restriction in the set. Moreover, only include an equality
restriction when you are really interested in it. If possible, I would
advise you to specify an about-equality restriction instead, as
discussed next (after the example).</p>

<!-- From this, you can conclude that $H_1: \mu_1 = \mu_2 > 0, \mu_3 > 0$ is $.817/.183 \approx 4.4$ times more supported than its complement. -->
<p>From this, you can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_1:
\mu_1 = \mu_2 &gt; 0, \ \mu_3 &gt; 0\)</span> is more supported than its
complement. When you look at the fit/loglik part, you see that both
fit/loglik values resemble; that is, the ratio of loglik.weights is
close to 1 (namely, .997). Thus, you can conclude that there is support
for the overlap/boundary of these hypotheses.</p>
<p>Here, the complement receives the highest fit; that is, the estimates
are in agreement with the complement. In this case, the fit of the
complement is based on the fit for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1
&gt; 0, \mu_2 &gt; 0, \mu_3 &gt; 0\)</span> (so, the hypothesis that
does not restrict the first two means to be equal). Consequently, the
preferred hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> does not
have the highest fit/loglik (it has the best fit-complexity balance).
Notably, since <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> contains an
equality, it will also never have maximum fit. Moreover, the weight for
a true equality hypothesis will never be 1. This could be a reason to
evaluate an about-equality hypothesis instead, as discussed in the next
section.</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:3:1.5;
implying that (the boundaries of) <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and its complement are both correct
(where <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is the most parsimonious
one). More specifically, I used population mean values of approximately
0.70, 0.70, and 0.35. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .16; thus, there is a
small to medium population effect size. I then sampled 100 observations,
ran an ANOVA (with three groups), and applied the GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, the fit/loglik values of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and its complement will remain close
(with the highest value for the complement) and the results are
conclusion-wise the same; but, more importantly, the weight for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> will not converge to 1.</p>

<div id="about-equality-restrictions" class="section level3">
<h3>About-equality restrictions</h3>
<p>Instead of equality restrictions (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \beta_2\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0\)</span>) one can specify
about-equality restrictions (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(-0.2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1
- \beta_2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span>). In this case, the hypothesis can
have a maximum fit and a GORIC(A) weight of 1.<br />
In practice, it can be hard to specify such a range. Notably, when the
range is too broad, the hypothesis will per definition have maximum fit.
In addition, the broader the range, the lower the fit for the
complement. Thus, you should specify the range meaningfully; preferably,
based on literature and/or expertise or perhaps data-based.</p>
<p><strong>If</strong> you use a <strong>data-based approach</strong> to
specify the range, it is best to use a <strong>training set</strong>
(when the sample size is large enough). In that case, one uses one part
of the data to come up with a range value for the about-equality
restriction and the other part of the data to evaluate the
about-equality restriction.<br />
When the sample size is not large enough, you could for example use a
cut-off value from the literature together with the standard deviation
(i.e., the standard errors of the mean difference times the square root
of the sample size). Bear in mind that you use the data twice, so only
use this when creating a training set is not possible.</p>

supported than its complement. Now, the fit/loglik value of this
about-equality hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is
the highest (while it will never be the case for an equality
hypothesis).<br />
Note that the fit values of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and
its complement are not close: the ratio of loglik.weights is <span class="math inline">\(.573/.427 \approx 1.34\)</span> (this ratio

<p>Population information: In the data generation, I used a ratio of

When I would sample more observations, the ratio of loglik weights of
<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and its complement will go to
infinity and, most importantly, the GORIC(A) weight of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> will converge to 1.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="not-highest-fit" class="section level2">
<h2>Not highest fit</h2>
<p>The GORIC(A), like the AIC or any other information criterion,
balances fit and complexity. You are thus looking for a trade-off: The
hypothesis that describes the data best with the fewest number of
parameters. Consequently, the preferred/best hypothesis does not need to
have the highest fit - then, the difference in complexity outweighs the
difference in fit.<br />
When the best hypothesis does not have maximum fit, you know that the
estimates (i.e., your data) are not fully in agreement with the
preferred hypothesis; they are in agreement with the hypothesis which
has maximum fit. Per definition, this scenario goes hand in hand with a
GORIC(A) weight for the preferred hypothesis being lower than 1.</p>
<p>In such cases, the sample size is not large enough to find convincing
evidence. In such a case, the GORIC(A) weights will also denote this
uncertainty, since none of the weights will be close to 1 (and perhaps
the weights will even be close together).</p>
<p>When you encounter such a situation, you may want to additionally
take on an additional exploratory approach to come up with a few
hypotheses for future research (by looking at sample means/estimates
taking into account what theoretically makes sense or by specifying some
plausible hypotheses which theoretically make sense). Then, in future
research, one can evaluate the new set of hypotheses with a larger
sample size.<br />
When you believe the lower fit is solely because of a small sample or
when you cannot create other theoretically meaningful hypotheses, you
should advise to inspect the same hypothesis with a larger sample size
in future research.</p>

<h3>Note on sample size</h3>
<p>When the preferred hypothesis does not have the highest fit, this is
an indication for having a too small sample - whether the hypothesis is
correct or not. In case of a small sample, the GORIC(A) weights will
also reflect this uncertainty - which can also be seen (indirectly) at
the end of the last section, where I inspect cases for various sample
sizes.</p>
<p>Let me also repeat the following:<br />
There are no cut-off values for fit values to resemble or for the ratio
of loglik.weights being close to 1 (only gut feelings). Since the fit
values depend on sample size, it is probably better to look the ratio of
loglik.weights. Additionally, it could help to check the estimates that
belong to those hypotheses (using, e.g., results_0c$ormle) and see if
they meaningfully differ.</p>

<div id="remarks-bayesian-model-selection" class="section level1">
<h1>Remarks Bayesian model selection</h1>
<p>All of the above also holds true for model selection using Bayes
factors (BFs; comparable to ratio of GORIC(A) weights) and posterior
model probabilities (PMPs; comparable to the GORIC(A) weights). However,
there is one extra element to take into account in case of Bayesian
model selection: prior sensitivity in case of at least one equality
restriction. In the R package bain, one can do this by checking the
results for multiple so-called fraction values; as shown in the first
example below.</p>
<p>In terms of conclusions (i.e., there is support for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> or not), the output of GORIC(A) and
bain are (often if not always) the same. In terms of the amount of
support, bain renders more support for hypotheses with equality
restrictions than the GORIC(A) does. This is the case when the equality
restrictions are correct but also when they are incorrect; where the
first is shown in the first example below and the latter in the second
example below.</p>

<p>From this, you can see (from BF.c) that the equality hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is approximately <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span> times more supported than its
complement when using a fraction of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:3:1.5;
implying that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is correct. More
specifically, I used population mean values of approximately 0.70, 0.70,
and 0.35. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .16; thus, there is a
small to medium population effect size. I then sampled 100 observations,
ran an ANOVA (with three groups), and applied bain.</p>
<p>Comparison bain and GORIC(A):<br />
In terms of conclusions (i.e., there is support for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> or not), the output of GORIC(A) and
bain are the same. In terms of the amount of support, bain renders more
support for equality restrictions than the GORIC(A). In this example,
this is good property, but: bain rendering more support for equality
restrictions happens both when the equality restrictions are
true/correct and when they are incorrect; as will be shown in the
examples below. Bear in mind that I advise on using about-equality
restrictions instead of equality restrictions.</p>

The order-restricted hypothesis &#39;H1&#39; has 3.86 times more support than its complement.</code></pre>
<p>From the bain output, you can see (from BF.c) that the incorrect
equality hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is
approximately <span class="math inline">\(19.5\)</span> times more
supported than its complement (when using a fraction of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>). From the GORIC output, you can see
that the incorrect equality hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is approximately <span class="math inline">\(3.8\)</span> times more supported than its
complement.</p>
<p>Population information:<br />
In the data generation, I used a ratio of population means of 3:2.5:1;
implying that <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is correct. More
specifically, I used population mean values of approximately 0.89, 0.74,
and 0.30. This implies that Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is approximately .25; thus, there is a
small to medium population effect size. I then sampled 100 observations,
ran an ANOVA (with three groups), and applied bain and the GORIC.<br />
When I would sample more observations, the support for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> will go to 0, for both methods; thus,
rendering full support for the complement. Note that the GORIC(A) will
conclude this sooner (i.e., for smaller samples) than bain will:</p>
<p>Below, you can find output for a sample size (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) of 1000 and 10000. In case of <span class="math inline">\(N = 1000\)</span>, GORIC already shows support for
the correct complement: The complement is <span class="math inline">\(.825/.175\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(4.71\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(1/.212\)</span>) times more supported than <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>; while bain still favors the
incorrect equality restriction: <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>
is <span class="math inline">\(.776/.224\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(3.46\)</span> times more supported than its
complement. In case of <span class="math inline">\(N = 10000\)</span>,
both methods show full support for the complement of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>.</p>
